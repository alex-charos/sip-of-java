Hey Java developers,

Need to parse an input source? 

Consider using the tokenize API part of the Scanner class

The Scanner class can handle many input sources; String, File, InputStream, and more

To tokenize the input source 

A regex can be provided to Scanner as a String, or as a Pattern, 

to define the delimiter

Processing the tokens can be done as a stream with, .tokens()

Or done as loop with hasNext and next 

Scanner also provides hasNext and next methods for the types; 

Int, Long, Boolean, Double, and others

allowing for checking and conversion to those types

Scanner can take a locale, 

allowing for easy localization of data

Like here treating the final value in the line 

as a String when used with the US Locale

But as a numeric, 

when used with the German Locale

Happy coding!
