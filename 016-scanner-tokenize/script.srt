Hey Java Developers,

2
00:00:02,066 --> 00:00:04,933
Need to parse an input source?

3
00:00:04,933 --> 00:00:07,266
Consider using the tokenize API

4
00:00:07,266 --> 00:00:08,866
part of the Scanner class

5
00:00:08,866 --> 00:00:08,966
The Scanner class can handle many input sources

6
00:00:08,966 --> 00:00:11,566
The Scanner class can handle many input sources

7
00:00:11,566 --> 00:00:13,833
String, File, InputStream, and more

8
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:15,533
To tokenize an input source 

9
00:00:15,533 --> 00:00:18,033
A regex can be provided to Scanner as

10
00:00:18,033 --> 00:00:20,766
a String, or as a Pattern, to define the delimiter

11
00:00:20,766 --> 00:00:24,500
Processing the tokens can be done as a stream with, .tokens()

12
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,766
Processing the tokens can be done as a stream with, .tokens()

13
00:00:25,766 --> 00:00:25,800
Processing the tokens can be done as a stream with, .tokens()

14
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,400
Or done as loop with hasNext and next

15
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:28,500
Or done as loop with hasNext and next

16
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,133
Or done as loop with hasNext and next

17
00:00:29,133 --> 00:00:32,933
Scanner also provides hasNext() and next() methods

18
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:35,833
For the types int, long boolean, double, and others

19
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:38,866
Allowing for checking and conversion to those types

20
00:00:38,866 --> 00:00:39,700
Allowing for checking and conversion to those types

21
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,833
Allowing for checking and conversion to those types

22
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,433
Scanner can take a locale,

23
00:00:42,433 --> 00:00:44,400
allowing for easy localization of data

24
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:44,433
allowing for easy localization of data

25
00:00:44,433 --> 00:00:45,166
allowing for easy localization of data

26
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:45,233
allowing for easy localization of data

27
00:00:45,233 --> 00:00:47,233
Like here treating the final value in the line

28
00:00:47,233 --> 00:00:48,633
as a String when used with the US Locale

29
00:00:48,633 --> 00:00:48,666
as a String when used with the US Locale

30
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:49,733
as a String when used with the US Locale

31
00:00:49,733 --> 00:00:50,866
as a String when used with the US Locale

32
00:00:50,866 --> 00:00:51,200
as a String when used with the US Locale

33
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,566
But as a numeric, 

34
00:00:51,566 --> 00:00:51,733
But as a numeric, 

35
00:00:51,733 --> 00:00:52,400
But as a numeric, 

36
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,233
when used with the German Locale

37
00:00:55,233 --> 00:00:57,033
Happy Coding!
