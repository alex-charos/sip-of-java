# Reading File Improvements

## Current State BufferedReader

* Complex to setup

* Loads all contents into heap memory

* So can be slow with large files

## Use Streams

* A bit simpler to use

* Stuff only read as needed

* Faster when not needing to read entire file contents!

## MultiMap further improvement

* Even simpler!

* JDK 16!
