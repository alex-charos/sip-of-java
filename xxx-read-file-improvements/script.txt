Hey Java developers,

Getting lost in a maze of if statements and loops when processing large files?

[Where am I?!]

been there, try using streams instead

Streams, added in Java 8, improve the experience of processing large data sets

Transforming deeply nested if, else, and loop hierachies into a simple pipeline 

With streams we can do a simple skip of the title line

Tokenize the values of a line and filter by date

Added in Java 16, mapMulti allow for 0 to n returns for an input 

Here being used for easy handling, when reading a row causes an error

Collectors, come with many pre-configured options for the grouping and ordering of items in a stream

Last we can handle the printing of the results, without a separate loop

If working with ordered data sets, consider takeWhile

Or dropWhile, both added in Java 9

Happy coding!
