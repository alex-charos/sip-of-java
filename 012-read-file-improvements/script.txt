Hey Java developers,

Lost in a maze of if statements and loops when processing large files?

been there, 

try using streams instead

Streams, added in Java 8, improve the experience of processing large data sets

Transforming deeply nested if, else, and loop hierarchies

Into a pipeline 

With streams we can do a simple skip of the title line

Tokenize the values of a line and filter by date

Added in Java 16, mapMulti allow for 0 to n returns

Being used here for handling when a mapping error occurs

Collectors, can be used for grouping and ordering items in a stream

Last we can handle the printing of the results with a forEach, instead needing a separate loop

With Java 16 returning a list can be done with .toList

When working with ordered data sets, consider takeWhile

Or dropWhile, both added in Java 9

Happy coding!
