Hey java developers,

Getting tangled in knots using Strings in Java?

[ funny bit with strings]

I've been there too 

Java has continued adding new convenience methods to String to help untangle those knots

isBlank, added in Java 11, fills the common need to check if a String only contains whitespace characters

stripLeading, stripTrailing, and strip all added in Java 11, remove leading whitespace, trailing whitespace, or both, from a String

line, also in Java 11, divides a string by carriage returns and returns the result as a stream of strings

Transform was added in Java 12 and allows a function to be applied to the string, and returns the result of the function

Finally in Java 15, formatted was added, allowing a String to be formatted directly

Happy Coding!
