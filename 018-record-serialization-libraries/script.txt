Hey Java developers,

Want to start using records 

But unsure about compatibility 

with your serialization library?

[ ]

Let's take a look at how 

three popular serialization libraries 

are supporting Records. 

Jackson began offering official support for Records with 2.12.0

Jackson supports records of any visibility, 

and even supports local records

Gson as of 2.8.8, 

only offers limited Record support

and official support is not on the roadmap

Top level and inner classes can be serialized

However deserialization requires 

defining a JsonDeserializer

Local records are not supported

For Moshi official support for Records

Should be part of their next release

Records will need to be public,

and local records are also not supported

Happy coding!
