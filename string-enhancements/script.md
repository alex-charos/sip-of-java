Hey java developers,

Ever needed to work with JSON, XML, or HTML in your code?

Yea, it can get ugly fast. 

When needing to work with large or multi-line strings, considering using Text Blocks

Text Blocks, added in Java 15, allow for writing multi-line string literals that avoid the need for most escape sequences.

Using text blocks, this near illegible mess, becomes this easily readible block of code [NEEDS IMPROVEMENT]

Text blocks also support string formatting,
