Hey Java developers,

Dealing with performance or runtime issues in production, but your Java application is a black box?

[Holding black coffee mug, "I don't understand it, but I will"]

Try using the JDK Flight Recorder!

The JDK Flight Recorder, JFR, is a JVM tool for 

collecting diagnostic and profiling data about a Java application

And has low overhead, 

so can even be used in production settings

To use JFR set the StartFlightRecording JVM argument

StartFlightRecording can take several arguments, 

filename, disk, settings, and others.

JFR recordings can be retrieved from a live application with jcmd

Or when an application terminates by setting dumponexit to true

Recordings can be viewed with tools like JDK Mission Control

Which provides many options for inspecting the behavior of a Java application

Happy coding!
