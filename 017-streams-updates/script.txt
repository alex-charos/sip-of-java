Hey Java developers,

Enjoying Streams since Java 8, 

but finding some holes in its functionality?

[ ]

Streams and its supporting types 

have seen several updates in recent releases

let's take a look at a few key changes

Teeing added to Collectors in Java 12   

Allows the results of two downstream collectors to be merged

Predicate was updated in Java 11 with the static not 

allowing for easier definition of a negation predicate 

ofNullable added in Java 9, 

provides null safety when processing a single item stream, 

returning the value if non-null, 

or an empty stream if the passed in value is null

iterate was also updated with java 9, 

allowing for a predicate to be provided

which functions as a hasNext 

and is checked before executing the "next" UnaryOperator

Happy coding!
