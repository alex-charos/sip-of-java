Hey Java Developers,

Did you know you can upgrade your Java runtime without needing to recompile your code?

[Comedy bit]

It's true!

And there are several reasons to consider upgrading your runtime, even if you are not planning on making code changes

Among the top reasons would be the performance improvements across; memory footprint, startup, ramp up, and throughput, that are made with every JDK release

Here running the Spring Boot Petclinic test app we can see significant performance improvements between running on JDK 8 and JDK 16, though the specific performance improvements you see will vary

New tools and improved features are also beng added with each release including; new garbage collectors like ZGC, improved observability with Java Flight Recorder, more helpful NullPointerExceptions, improved class data sharing support, and more!

Happy coding!
