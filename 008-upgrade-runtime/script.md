Hey java developers,

Did you know you can run old Java code on new runtimes without recompiling?

[Comedy bit]

It's true!

And there are a lot of reasons to do this also!

One of the most common reasons to run even old Java binaries on the latest Java runtimes is to take advantage of the many JVM improvements over the past Java releases

Security is always a top priority, and by running on the latest runtime you can have the best confidence your applications are secure

Happy coding!
