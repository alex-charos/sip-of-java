Hey Java Developers,

Did you know you can upgrade your Java runtime without needing to recompile your code?

[Comedy bit]

It's true!

And there are several reasons to consider upgrading your runtime, even if you are not planning on using the new APIs

With every JDK release there are improvements across; memory footprint, startup, ramp up, and throughput

In this load test of the Spring Boot Petclinic app, we see significant improvements between running on JDK 8 and JDK 16, though the specific performance improvements you see may differ

Security is always a top priority and you can have the best confidence your applications are running on a secure runtime by being on the latest JDK release

Some other runtime improvements include; ZGC, New and improved AArch64 support, More events types tracked by JFR, better container support, improved AppCDS support, modular runtime and custom java images with jlink, helpful NPEs, and more!

Happy coding!
