Hey Java Developers,

Did you know you can upgrade your Java runtime without needing to recompile your code?

[Comedy bit]

It's true!

And there are several reasons to consider upgrading your runtime, even if you are not planning on using the new APIs

With every JDK release there are improvements across; memory footprint, startup, ramp up, and throughput

In this load test of the Spring Boot Petclinic app, we see significant improvements between running on JDK 8 and JDK 16, though the specific performance improvements you see may differ

Security is always a top priority and you can have the best confidence your applications are running on a secure runtime by being on the latest JDK release

New and improved runtime tools and features are also available for use including; ZGC, better container support for JDK Flight Recorder, helpful NullPointerExceptions, improved AppCDS support, and more!

Happy coding!
