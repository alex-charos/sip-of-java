Hey Java developers,

Excited for Java Records 

but wondering where they fit in 

if you are using JPA for data access?

[Comedy bit]

Consider using records as projections!

Added in java 16, Records are transparent carriers of data, 

and can be defined in a single line

Because of the constraints on records, 

are unsuitable as JPA entities, 

but can be used as projections 

If using straight JPA, 

Records can be used with CriteriaBuilders, 

TypedQueries

And Native Queries

Spring Data also supports records 

If the record matches the field names of the tracked entity, 

Spring data can automatically handle the mapping

Alternatively, a JPA query can be defined

Or a custom repo implementation 

can be used to handle the mapping of the query results 

to the record

Happy coding!
