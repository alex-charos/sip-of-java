Hey Java developers,

Frustrated having to deal with hanging commas, carriage returns, and other nasty bits when transforming lists of items into a string?

[ funny bit with strings]

Me too 

When transforming lists into strings, considering using the join APIs, all available in JDK 8

StringJoiner can take either just a delimiter, or also a optional prefix and suffix. 

Items can be added to a StringJoiner individually

Or if the items are contained in an Iterable, StringJoiner::add can be referenced within a forEach call

Alternatively a String list can be built using a stream and Collector.join()

Like with StringJoiner, the prefix and suffix values are optional

If you only need a delimiter, consider String.join 

Provide the delimiter, and either an iterable of the items to be added

Or pass the values in as varargs, like seen here

Happy coding!
