Hey java developers,

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:08,966
Ever needed to define a collection, but getting cramps from all the typing?

3
00:00:08,966 --> 00:00:10,066
Same

4
00:00:10,066 --> 00:00:15,600
Good news, there the Convenience Factory Methods for Collections added in Java 9

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,600
With the List factory method "of"

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,500
you can quickly define a List instance, like in this example of Strings

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,733
The same syntax is also available for Sets, with Set.of

8
00:00:27,733 --> 00:00:32,166
When needing to define a map instance "of" can also be used

9
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:36,933
but the provided values must match key and value types

10
00:00:36,933 --> 00:00:40,966
of the map in an alternating pattern, like in this example

11
00:00:40,966 --> 00:00:45,900
Alternatively Map.ofEntries can be used with the

12
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,966
java.util.Map.entry static method

13
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:50,700
 for better readability

14
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,133
at the cost of a little extra typing

15
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:54,499
Happy coding!
