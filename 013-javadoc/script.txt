Hey Java developers,

JavaDoc

[Me asleep]

Please don't fall asleep yet! JavaDoc has seen a number of updates in recent releases, improving its usability

Key among these changes was the addition of search, part of JDK 9

Search can be a great way of exploring and discovering the API on official JavaDocs

Search is also available by default in all generated JavaDoc

Also with JDK 9 JavaDoc is generated in HTML 5 by default, improving its accessibility 

Several tags have been added improving API definition:

Index, which can be used for defining domain terms and acronyms

Hidden, for API documentation you don't want published

SystemProperties, for system provided values

And tags for defining modules features and behavior

And more

Happy Coding!
