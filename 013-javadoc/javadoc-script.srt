Hey Java Developers

00:00:03,166 --> 00:00:04,066
[snoring]

4
00:00:04,066 --> 00:00:06,066
Please don't fall asleep yet! 

5
00:00:06,066 --> 00:00:09,166
JavaDoc has seen a number of updates in recent releases,

6
00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:10,833
improving its usability

7
00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:13,466
Key among these changes was the addition of search

8
00:00:13,466 --> 00:00:15,033
part of JDK 9

9
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:16,800
Search can be a great way of exploring

10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,800
and discovering the API on official JavaDocs

11
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:19,833
Search is also available by default in all generated JavaDoc

12
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:20,200
Search is also available by default in all generated JavaDoc

13
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,433
Search is also available by default in all generated JavaDoc

14
00:00:23,433 --> 00:00:23,466
Search is also available by default in all generated JavaDoc

15
00:00:23,466 --> 00:00:24,566
Search is also available by default in all generated JavaDoc

16
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:27,766
Several tags have been added improving API definition:

17
00:00:27,766 --> 00:00:31,733
Including Index, which can be used for defining domain terms and acronyms

18
00:00:31,733 --> 00:00:33,233
Including Index, which can be used for defining domain terms and acronyms

19
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:36,433
Hidden, for API documentation you don't want published

20
00:00:36,433 --> 00:00:38,033
Hidden, for API documentation you don't want published

21
00:00:38,033 --> 00:00:40,800
SystemProperties, for system provided values

22
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,566
SystemProperties, for system provided values

23
00:00:42,566 --> 00:00:44,466


24
00:00:44,466 --> 00:00:47,433
And tags for defining modules features and behavior

25
00:00:47,433 --> 00:00:47,700
And tags for defining modules features and behavior

26
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,133
Also with JDK 9 

27
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:51,900
JavaDoc is generated in HTML 5 by default

28
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,600
improving its accessibility 

29
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,900
Happy Coding!
