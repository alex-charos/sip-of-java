Hey java developers,

Ever needed to work with JSON, XML, or multi-line strings in your code?

[scream]

Yea, it can get ugly fast. 

In these situations, considering using a Text Block

Added in Java 15, Text blocks are delimited with trip quotes, and transform this near illegible mess, into an easily readable block of code, by preserving formatting and line breaks and negating the need for most escape sequences.

Text Blocks can also be used with String formatting, so you can easily supply values into a text block

Text Blocks can even be used with really long lines. Adding a backslash at the end of a line, ignores the carriage return allowing the string to be printed as a single line

Happy coding!
