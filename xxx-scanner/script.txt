Hey Java developers,

Need to search an input source for specific content?

[Searching for something]

Consider the Scanner class

The Scanner class can handle many input sources; String, File, InputStream, and more

Using findAll scanner will search the entire input source 

and return the results as a stream of MatchResults 

Search criteria can be a String literal or regex

A pattern instance can also be used

For more precise control there is findInLine and findInHorizon

findInLine returns the first match in a line

To check for more matches in a line, findInLine can be called again

To move through the input source use hasNextLine and nextLine 

nextLine, will return any skipped content as a String

findInHorizon, behaves similar to findInLine, 

but allows a specific search area to be defined

Happy Coding!
